What-i-wore

This is my final project for LaunchCode's LC101 class. It was an independent project to show both the skills I learned in class 
as well as my capacity for researching and learning on my own.
It is an app to keep track of what you wore on specific occasions. Pictures can be uploaded and tagged with useful reminders of 
what you were doing, and who you were with. The idea is that then the next time you are going to the same location, you can 
click on tags to be shown what you wore there before. It also serves as an inspirational gallery.

Built With:

Gradle - Build management
MySQL via MAMP - Database creation and table definitions
